To be done:
* LOD scale down the small rocks

* put a ship in, allow movement around the world (w gravity)
  - ship has a rotation, velocity, and mass
  - ship has finite hitpoints
  - ship has a finite energy store, which slowly recharges

* ship: small impacts lower hitpoints

* ship: L shift activates shields (erodes power)

* ship: has a laser (' ') which erodes rocks (damages ships)
    animate as a moving stipple between frames
    (rebind step to something else)
     the laser beam slowly erodes rock

* ship laser: define an effect that alpha blends out to render the laser
    - beam into the object (stop there)
    - the object hit erodes slightly (small pieces fall off)

* ship: L control fires a missile

* inhabited planets have an orbital platform above where the ship can dock
  (similar to absorption)
   - refuels, rearms, empties cargo

* enemy ships periodically show up and patrol/attack

* make a scrolling map (and minimap that shows major planets)
   - large planets become pinned 

* planets can be settled
